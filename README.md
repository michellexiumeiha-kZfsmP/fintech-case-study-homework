# FINTECH CASE STUDY: SPRING LABS
Oct 11, 2021

## Overview

Blockchain startup Spring Labs utilises a permissioned decentralised network to  enable accurate and secure information exchange between businesses without divulging underlying sensitive business or consumer data. 

The data exchange allows members to:

* Verify identities of consumers
* Conduct credit risk assessments
* Prevent and identify fraudulent activity
* Access income stability indicators (risk scores)
* Facilitate underwriting decisions
* Improve acquisition marketing

## How did the idea come about?

The 2017 cyber attack on credit reporting agency Equifax compromised the records of 163 million people highlighted the security vulnerabilities of a single point of entry source for consumer data. 

In addition, Spring Lab founders, all previous members of online lender Avant noted frustrations with the accuracy and the lack of granularity provided by the traditional credit data models, controlled by a small group of credit bureaus and sought to disrupt the current model of credit identity.


>>> Jiwan, describes the purpose of spring labs is to “reinvent how information is gathered, shared and monetised”


Based on pillars of:
* **Accuracy** – real time verification and cross validation from multiple sources (multi-party attestation) from financial institutions, insurance companies, utility companies and others.
* **Privacy** – for consumer data as personal identify information (PII) remains within the confines of business
* **Security** – from one-source entry and storing data in decentralised network theoretically allows for more security
* **Risk management and fraud prevention** - in prevention of synthetic identity fraud
* Monetisation – value is given to those that participate in the network
* **Financial inclusion** – use of more alternative credit and asset information to create a more granular and accurate credit profile of consumers and businesses will make credit more accessible to those that have not traditionally been allowed access


## The Founders

The founders have extensive experience in founding and building various FinTech companies, particularly online lenders:
* [Avant]( https://www.avant.com/) (personal loan lender)
* [Future Finance]( https://www.futurefinance.com/ ) (student loan provider)
* [Enova Financial]( https://www.enova.com/) (consumer and business lender)

## Funding

To date, the company has received US$68.8m over three funding rounds (Seed, Round A and Round B), indicating an established user base and a demand for expansion. 


## Business Activities and use cases

Spring Labs plays a complementary role to financial institutions, lending and other non-lending institutions requiring identity verification and consumer profiles. 

Existing use cases include:

* *Fraud reduction* – the sharing of real time, sensitive and confidential data between lenders over the Spring Network, was able to reduce the occurrence of a  common fraud known lien stacking. This is where borrowers simultaneously apply for and are approved for loans with multiple lenders. Sharing this data allows lenders to identify such occurrences where other lenders are in the process of approving loans to the same borrower.

* *Synthetic identify fraud* – Auto-lenders encounter a risk of fraudulent purchases by individuals creating false identities when making purchases. Credit identify verification using multi-factor and multi-party attestation over the blockchain enables for “better, faster and cheaper” verification of individuals result in reduced prevention costs and operational losses.

* *Granular consumer income profiles* – called Income Stability Indicators, involves the aggregation of economic, in addition to other transposed with industry, geographic and predictive modelling allow for risk assessments not previously attainable through conventional income data. This information is aimed at enhancing marketing approaches, underwriting processes and credit line assessments. Read more about this [here](https://isi.springlabs.com/)



Spring Labs also seeks incentivise participants with value in the form of cryptocurrency.


## Competitors and competitive advantage

Incumbent credit rating agencies such as Equifax, with market capitalisation of US$31B and TransUnion, US$21B market capitalisation are obvious competitors to Spring Labs which aims to disrupt the traditional method of credit identity verification and rating.

Spring Labs hold a competitive advantage as key components to the success of such technology is the ubiquitous uptake and vast core of financial and non-financial data to draw from, which it is on it’s way to achieving with partnerships with TransUnion and GM Financial.

In addition, the use of a permissioned decentralised network and advanced cryptography protects sensitive company data and adheres to regulatory requirements for the protection of sensitive consumer data provides further incentive for participation in the Spring Network.

## Technologies

Spring Labs, developed the Spring Network on the Ethereum blockchain to create a decentralised platform to enable more secure information sharing.

Advanced cryptography via smart contracts create tokenised data to allow information to be shared without identifying the original source of the data or the underlying consumer data. 

Finally, products are available through REST APIs.

## Domain and landscape

Spring Labs operations in the blockchain and cryptocurrency domain, playing a complementary role to financial institutions and lenders and a disruptive role to credit rating and consumer data agencies such as credit bureaus. 

The market for loans is enormous with the [US consumer loans balance](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/) alone totalling over US$4 trillion in August 2021.

The demand for lending drives a requirement to better, more accurately, assess risks and underwrite loans, with technology companies set to revolutionise the way this is done.

Venture capital investment in FinTech has grown by US$110 billion to US$288  billion worldwide in [2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/09/09/fintechs-can-redefine-credit-ratings-to-drive-tech-companies-growth/?sh=465568fb2d27) reinforcing a demand for services provided technology companies.

In terms of Identity verification, blockchain company Civic Identity Verification (CVC) provides an alternative to Spring Labs. At CVC information is available for lenders to access once a consumer provides permission for the data to be accessed. A key differentiator is CVC creates separate blockchain based identification via it’s Secure Identity Platform (SIP), while Spring Labs utilises the existing data of the financial and non-financial participants to verify identities. This allows for scalable pool of data as it does not rely on individual consumer buy-in.


## Future Potential

The wider application of peer-to-peer information sharing amongst financial and non-financial institutions is huge. Increasing regulatory “Know Your Customer” (KYC) requirements creates additional demand faster, more automated, accurate and cheaper methods of customer verification. 

Further, the ability to use alternative information for accessing credit worthiness and in the creation of consumer profiles allows for improvement in predictive modelling, all of which can be used for financial and marketing purposes. The scope for the aggregation of such data is immense and goes beyond merely credit identity verification and enabling credit accessibility.
